# Automated ELK Stack Deployment
The files in this repository were used to configure the network dipicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above or alternatively, select portions of the file may be used to install only certain pieces of it such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main puropse of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*amn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available and reliable, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.

- Load balancers protect the system from Denial-Of-Service attacks. Because it evenly distributes incoming web traffic and data, it helps prevent and mitigate the potential of a server overload.

- The advantage of a jumpbox is having the ability to access different web servers or networks while maintaining a controlled and secure connection. It acts as a configured gateway between machines.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to their file systems and network as well as watch system metrics, such as CPU usage; attempted SSH logins; 'sudo' escalation failures; etc.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below:

| Name        | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box    | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux/ Microsoft |
| Web-1       | Webserver| 10.0.0.5   | Linux/ Microsoft |
| Web-2       | Webserver| 10.0.0.6   | Linux/ Microsoft |
| ELK Server  | Webserver| 10.1.0.4   | Linux/ Microsoft |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public internet.

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP address:
- 75.73.153.56 (My Host Machine)

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the Jump Box VM. The Jump Box VM was allowed access to the ELK Server VM with the private IP address of 10.0.0.4.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below:

| Name       | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
|  Jump Box  |        Yes          |      75.73.153.56    |
|   Web-1    |        No           |        10.0.0.4      |
|   Web-2    |        No           |        10.0.0.4      |
| ELK Server |        No           |        10.0.0.4      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK Server machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because of the accessibility and ease of utilising Ansible. Ansible provides the installations and all of the required files. Being able to go to the site to copy the modules to formulate the playbook makes it a quick and cost-effective task. Doing it manually would be both time consuming and tedius, so the accessibility to Ansible is beneficial to all.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
  - First, it configures the ELK machine with Docker
  - Second, it installs the Python3 package, Pip.
  - Third, there is a Docker Python module that is installed.
  - Fourth, a Sysctl module was implemented for more memory.
  - Fifth, a Docker ELK container was downloaded.
  - Lastly, the Systemd Module enabled Docker on boot.

The following screenshot displays the configured ELK installation playbook:

The following screenshot displays the result of running 'docker ps' after successfully configuring the ELK instance:

### Target Machines and Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
  - Web-1 10.0.0.5
  - Web-2 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
  - Filebeat
  - Packetbeat
  - Metricbeat

These beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
  - Filebeat: Collects data, such as log files, then monitors and sends it to the specified output.
  - Packetbeat: Collects packets on the network and traces all of the activity on that server.
  - Metricbeat: Collects metric data from the specified servers and monitors then sends it to the output. 
    - For example, metricbeat might monitor a spike amount of users that have been attempting to log into the system. It will then gather and record that data.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, one will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming they have such a control node provisioned:
  - SSH into the control mode.
  - Update the file to include the .cfg file configurations and the playbook configuration.
  - Run the playbook, and navigate to the Kibana website through the ELK server to check that the installation worked as expected.

### Using the Playbook Continued
1. Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?

The playbook file would be the YAML file that one creates. It is copied into the /etc/ansible directiory from the container.

  - The following screenshot displays an example of an executed .yml playbook:

2. Which file does one update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine?

One would update the host file of the /etc/ansible directory and ensure that it is accurate to their selected machine's IP address.

  - The following screenshot displays an example of host file configurations:

3. How does one specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?

It can be specified through the ansible playbook.

4. Which URL does one have to navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

They would navigate to http://[your.VM.IP]:5601/app/kibana. For example, mine was http://13.64.91.233:5601/app/kibana. This should load the Kibana homepage.

  - The following screenshot displays an example of a successful Kibana connection:
